# DigiHex

An **Android/iOS SDK** that enables execution of **cURL commands on mobile devices**. Currently, mobile vendors do not provide native support for cURL execution, making it difficult for developers and testers to measure critical network parameters directly from mobile apps.  

**DigiHex** bridges this gap by allowing apps to run cURL-like commands and fetch important diagnostic and performance metrics.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This SDK is currently **internal only** and **not for public use**. Public release will be announced once it is production-ready.

  - Speed at Data Caching Centres  
  - Connection time, download speed, and response headers  
  - Other cURL-based performance insights  
- Lightweight and easy to integrate  
- Works offline (no vendor dependency)
